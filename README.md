============

Harry Potter themed MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) developed during my postgraduate course.

The game itself is in portuguese, I will translate it to English in the near future, so other students can understand and learn from it too.

I've included in this repository 2 Windows Builds (one for each project), which are zipped inside their respective folders. Just unzip and play them on your machine to test it.

Tips to make it easier to test this MUD:
----------------------------------------

If you wanna download the project to study it's code, it'll make it easier for you to run the Client on a build (web player or pc/mac build) and run the Server on Unity Editor, since the Client's only functions are to connect to the server and send messages, there is nothing much interesting in there to debug.

The characters and names used on this project do not belong to me, they come from the Harry Potter books and belong to their writer, [J. K. Rowling](http://www.jkrowling.com/).

This project is Harry Potter themed just for fun, with no comercial intentions.
